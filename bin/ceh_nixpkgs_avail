# without wrappers the resulting installation is not as useful as
# something that is included in ceh, but you can still access the
# executables through ~/.nix-profile/bin, so good for quick
# experimentation.

# Available packages can be listed  with: ceh_nixpkgs_avail
# Installed packages can be listed  with: nix-env -q '*'
# Installed packages can be deleted with: nix-env -e foobar
