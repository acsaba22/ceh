# firefox17Wrapper (because of flash), googletalkplugin and java are
# not free software, so they are not distributed in the binary cache
# of nix.  Therefore we can't install them from there.  The best we
# can do is to try to install via derivations and fail if the hash
# value of the end result is incorrect.  Unfortunately this means that
# when we upgrade ceh to newer versions of nixpkgs, we have to
# remember to update here, otherwise new users can't install firefox.

# This is a 32-bit FF install (working on both amd64 and i686) with
# all the 3 required plugins:
#  - google talk,
#  - java,
#  - flash,
# please make sure to remove all the conflicting plugins from your
# system (~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins, /usr/lib/mozilla, etc.).
#
# To make sure everything is OK, use all 3 plugins while running
# firefox from a terminal and watch stderr.
#
# Do not ever mix 64-bit plugins with this firefox!
